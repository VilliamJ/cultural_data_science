That is why we often remove \"stopwords\", that is, a list of the most common words in English, before e.g. counting frequencies. There are several of these lists available, in [English]((https://gist.github.com/sebleier/554280)) as well as other languages, such as [Danish](https://gist.github.com/berteltorp/0cf8a0c7afea7f25ed754f24cfc2467b). Below is some starter code to remove stopwords. Use these snippets to see what the most common words in Emma and Moby Dick are after removing these most common words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: In Moby Dick, you will also have to remove the string `\\r`, in addition to removing `\\n`."
